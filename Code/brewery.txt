# Abridged Character Creation
This is a quick guide to character creation for dungeons and dragons 5th addition!  While most every edition has it's benefits and drawbacks, 5th edition's strength is the ease of use and speed of generating content.  Please note that this guide is a quick and dirty way to set up characters, but not definitive.  All information found here is available in the [*2014 Player's Handbook*](https://github.com/Yamz64/CharacterCreationGuide/blob/main/Handbooks/Player's%20Handbook.pdf).  Some classes or races may not be included here or in the handbook, but are found in expansion guides, such as *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*, or *Volo's Complete Subrace Handbook*.  If you find something that you would like to use for your character that isn't included in the core rulebooks, bring it up with your DM!

## Goregutz and Materials

###
Before creating or playing D&D 5th edition, you will need some materials.  This includes but is not limited to the following items:

<!-- Material Bullet List Here: -->
{{coloredBullet 
 {{coloredBulletLine
   - A full set of playing dice.  This includes d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20 dice.  Where the number denotes the amount of sides to the dice.  While this can be handled using an app on your phone or in your browser, it is fun to roll physical dice!
}}
  {{coloredBulletLine
   - A character sheet.  This could be an excel sheet, an online character sheet, the classic [pdf](https://media.wizards.com/2022/dnd/downloads/DnD_5E_CharacterSheet_FormFillable.pdf) included with the *Player's Handbook*, or good old fashioned pencil and paper.
  }}

{{color:DarkGreen 
This guide not only lays out the steps to making characters in 5th edition, but provides examples.  These examples take form in a character we will create together, an Orc barbarian known as Goregutz Teefgrabba, or Goregutz for short.  Don't worry if you don't completely follow everything in his examples.  A sample character sheet will be provided at the end.

## The Character Sheet
###
:

Before we get started with any major character building we need to familiarize ourselves with the character sheet, as well as how to roll for stats.  We will start by going over ability scores and how to roll for them.  Afterwards we will move onto other important terms and regions on the character sheet.  If an area is not described in this guide, it is most likely an aesthetic field that is up to your imagination, or something that will be explained later on.

:

### Ability Scores

:

These are what we can consider your core stats.  They affect many other stats on the sheet and determine much of what your character is capable of.  It can be helpful to think about these stats in terms of interacting with a tomato in the event that you ever get confused with what they mean.

\page

<!-- Ability Scores go here -->
{{coloredBullet
{{coloredBulletLine
- **Strength (STR) -** How hard you can squeeze a tomato 
}}
{{coloredBulletLine
- **Dexterity (DEX) -** How fast and accurately you can throw a tomato
}}
{{coloredBulletLine
- **Constitution (CON) -** How many bad tomatoes you can eat
}}
{{coloredBulletLine
- **Intelligence (INT) -** How you know a tomato is a fruit
}}
{{coloredBulletLine
- **Wisdom (WIS) -** How not to include tomato in a fruit-based salad
}}
{{coloredBulletLine
- **Charisma (CHA) -** How to sell a tomato based fruit salad to someone
}}
}}

:

There are 2 popular methods of determining ability scores of a character: rolling for stats, and using [point buy](https://chicken-dinner.com/5e/5e-point-buy.html).  To roll for stats, roll 4d6 dice per stat, drop the lowest number and optionally reroll 1s.

{{color:DarkGreen
For example: if we were to roll stats for Goregutz, we would roll 4d6 dice 6 times.  For the first roll, we get 1 + 2 + 6 + 2.  We are playing with the reroll 1s rule, so that 1 got rerolled to a 5.  We also drop the 2 since that is the lowest dice roll.  This leaves us with 13, not bad.  We do this 5 more times and end up with the following stat rolls 13, 13, 14, 11, 15, and 11.  We can then choose to allocate these stats to whatever ability scores we choose.  Goregutz will have a 15 in STR, a 14 in CON, a 13 in DEX, a 13 in WIS, an 11 in INT and an 11 in CHA.
}}

::


### Saving Throws

:

Sometimes the Dungeon Master will ask you to roll what is called a "Saving Throw."  This is a check to see how likely your character will succeed in a certain scenario.  For example, if a character is trying to dodge a fireball, they may have to make a Dexterity Saving throw.

:

Saving throws are calculated by taking an ability score, subtracting 10, dividing what is left by 2, and rounding down.  This result is known as a **stat bonus.**  Should a character be proficient in a skill, by any means, their saving throw will increase by their proficiency score, which is determined by their highest class level.

{{color:DarkGreen
In the previous example Goregutz had a STR score of 15.  To calculate his STR saving throw: we would subtract 10 leaving us with 5.  We would then divide 5  by 2, leaving us with 2.5.  Finally we would round down, leaving us with 2.  This means that with Goregutz's STR of 15, he would have a **STR bonus** of +2.  This STR bonus is also his saving throw.  Should Goregutz be proficient in strength saves, he would gain an additional +2 from his proficiency bonus to that save.
}}

### Skills

:

Skills are minor stats belonging to your character.  They include skills like Athletics, Perception, and Sleight of Hand.  They are usually used in minor roleplay scenarios, but some skills may come up in more dire circumstances.  When calculating a skill's bonus, notice the abbreviated ability scores next to them.  This will tell you which of the core stats influence that skill.  You would then calculate that skill, the same way that you would a saving throw.  However, you must have proficiency in that skill to gain any additional bonuses to it.  Proficiency in a saving throw will not influence the skill!

:

{{color:DarkGreen
For example: to determine Goregutz's Perception skill, we need to know his **WIS bonus**, which we could calculate the same way as before: by subtracting 10 from his WIS score, dividing by 2, and dropping the decimal point.  This means that Goregutz's WIS bonus is +1, which would be his perception skill.  Should Goregutz be proficient in Perception (not WIS saves), he would gain an additional +2 from his proficiency bonus.
}}

:

{{thinLine
Note: Unlike Saving throws, characters can go beyond proficiency in a skill, and gain what is called: "Expertise."  Should a character gain expertise in a skill, by any means.  They would gain double their proficiency bonus.
}}

## Race, Class, & Background

### Race

:

The first step to character creation is choosing a race.  Races provide both mechanical advantages, and aesthetic quirks (for short, we call these quirks "flavor").  Races often provide the following mechanics:

<!-- Race Mechanics List Goes Here: -->
{{coloredBullet
{{coloredBulletLine
- **Ability Score Increase:** Every race has bonuses to stats.  Usually this comes in the form of +2 to one stat, and +1 to another stat.  Some races in some of the expansion guides have negatives to their stats.
}}
{{coloredBulletLine
- **Size:** Every race has a size associated with them.  While most races are "medium" sized, they can be smaller- down to size "tiny."
}}
{{coloredBulletLine
- **Speed:** Most races have a walkspeed of 30ft per turn.  While races in the *Player's Handbook,* can have less speed.  Races in some of the expansions can have more. 
}}
{{coloredBulletLine
- **Additional Mechanics:** Races may come with other abilities not described in the previous bullets.
}}
}}
::

Unless you are playing a mechanically focused game, a character's flavor is just as important.  Races provide various descriptions as well as aesthetic stats.  The more aesthetic stats are as follows:

<!-- Race Aesthetics List Goes Here: -->
{{coloredBullet
{{coloredBulletLine
- **Age:** Different races live for different timespans.  Some die relatively young, and some live to become ancient beings.  When thinking of a character's age, it may be helpful to take into account what stage of life they are in.  Are they old?  Are they young?
}}
{{coloredBulletLine
- **Alignment:** Some races are more inclined to a specific alignment.  While you do not have to follow this when creating your character.  It is still important to keep in mind as it may affect how others perceive your character ingame.
}}
{{coloredBulletLine
- **Languages:** Many races have their own languages.  Being a part of a race allows you to learn that language.  Depending on the setting, this may affect who you can converse with.
}}
}}

The following races are included in the *Player's Handbook* (please note that the expansion books may contain additional races, subraces, and balancing changes):

<!-- Race List Here: -->
{{coloredBullet
- Dwarf
- Elf
- Halfling
- Human
- Dragonborn
- Gnome
- Half-Elf
- Half-Orc
- Tiefling
}}

:

Many races also have **subraces** to consider when creating your character.  Subraces may have additional ability score increases, abilities, or other bonuses that get added on top of the parent race's. If the race you picked has multiple subraces, you must also pick one of them.

:

{{color:DarkGreen 

If we were to pick a race for Goregutz, we could use the "Orc" race and "Mountain Orc" subrace, from [*Volo's Complete Subrace Handbook*](https://github.com/Yamz64/CharacterCreationGuide/blob/main/Handbooks/Volo's%20Complete%20Subrace%20Handbook.pdf).  But to keep things consistent with using base *Player's Handbook* material, we will use the "Half-Orc" race.  

}}

:

{{color:DarkGreen

This gives him +2 Strength (17), and +1 Constitution (15).  It also gives him medium size, a movement speed of 30ft per turn, Darkvision, proficiency in the intimidation skill, the *"Relentless Endurance"* ability, the *"Savage Attacks"* ability, and the Orcish language.

}}

:

{{pageNumber 3}}
{{footnote RACE, CLASS, & BACKGROUND}}
\page

{{color:DarkGreen

Additionally, we can add some flavor to Goregutz based on his race.  Orcs (as per [*Volo's Guide to Monsters*](https://github.com/Yamz64/CharacterCreationGuide/blob/main/Handbooks/Volo's%20Guide%20to%20Monsters.pdf)) reach maturity at age 12 and can live up to 50 years.  Goregutz is a little over middle aged, so we can assume that he is around 35 years old.  Most Orcs have the chaotic evil alignment.  Goregutz is like most Orcs, but works as a mercenary.  He values getting paid more than simply "krumping" his enemies, so he is more of a chaotic neutral character.  While it may seem like he is tall, he is actually average among Orcs, standing at around 7' 2" and weighing 250lbs.

}}

::

### Class

:

While races provide an important mechanical start, and flavorful background for your character.  The class is what you will be spending the most time with.  You can think of it as your character's job.  Are they a knight in shining armor?  They may be a paladin.  Are they a conniving thief?  They may be a rogue.  Do they raise the dead?  They might be a wizard.  It is important to research and decide what class you want to play, as it not only determines how you play the game, but also further builds your character's personality and aesthetics.  

:

When applying stats and bonuses from your class, it is oftentimes helpful to break it into steps:

<!-- Steps To Setting Up Class: -->
{{coloredBullet
{{coloredBulletLine 1. Set your initial health}}
{{coloredBulletLine 2. Write down your proficiencies}}
{{coloredBulletLine 3. Get your starting equipment}}
{{coloredBulletLine 4. Add any bonuses/abilities from leveling up}}
}}

Your class gives you what is called a "Hit Die."  It is primarily used for giving you hitpoints based on your level, but may be used for other things in the game.  Whenever you level up, you roll your hit die and add your constitution modifier to the roll.  Whatever the result is, is what you increase your maximum HP by.  At level 1, you simply get the maximum possible HP from a hit die roll.

:

{{color:DarkGreen
For example: if we are setting up initial hitpoints (HP) for Goregutz.  We need to take into account his class and level.  To make things simple, we will say Goregutz is a level 1 Barbarian.  This means that his hit die is 1d12.  At level 1 his HP is the maximum that a roll could be: 12 + CON modifer (modifier is another way of saying stat bonus).  This leaves Goregutz with 14 hitpoints.  Every level after this, Goregutz will have to roll his d12 for more maximum HP.
}}

\column

Classes offer proficiencies in armor, weaponry, tools, saving throws, and a list of skills.  Wearing armor that you are not proficient in can result in severe penalties (disadvantage on all ability checks/saves/attack rolls that involve STR or DEX as well as the inability to cast spells).  All other proficiencies allow you to add your proficiency bonus to what was previously listed (attacks, tools, saves etc.) 

:

Starting equipment is unique to whatever class your character is.  Some Dungeon Masters may require that you spend gold on this equipment, however.

{{color:DarkGreen
As a Barbarian, Goregutz gets access to (a) a greataxe or (b) any martial melee weapon.  In proper Orcy fashion, he picks a greataxe.  He additionally gets the choise of (a) two handaxes or (b) any simple weapon.  He opts to pick a club from the simple weapons table.  Finally he gets an explorer's pack and 4 javelins.
}}

:

Finally, you gain access to all your abilities from leveling.  Even starting a class at level 1, means that you level up once, so you gain the level 1 abilities from your class's table.

{{color:DarkGreen
At level 1, Goregutz gains access to "Rage", and "Unarmored Defense" from the Barbarian Table.
}}

:

*The Player's Handbook* Gives access to 12 classes.  However, expansion guides add many more classes as well as balance changes to some of the classes listed in *The Player's Handbook*.  The base classes are as follows:

<!-- Class List Here!: -->
{{coloredBullet
{{coloredBulletLine
- **Barbarian** - A fierce warrior of primitive background who can enter a battle rage
}}
{{coloredBulletLine
- **Bard** - An inspiring magician whose power echoes the music of creation
}}
{{coloredBulletLine

### Background

:

The final step of creating a character is choosing a background.  A background is the title your character is given based on their life prior to becoming an adventurer. All backgrounds will give you additional skill proficiencies, but vary widely in additional bonuses they can give.  Some will give you items, languages, social bonuses, or even feats.  Backgrounds may even come with tables to help you decide personality traits when designing your character.  Much of what is provided is optional; and it is up to you to pick whatever background that suits your character.

Goregutz was a mercenary, so it makes most sense to pick the "Mercenary Veteran" background from the [Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide](https://github.com/Yamz64/CharacterCreationGuide/blob/main/Handbooks/Sword%20Coast%20Adventurer%20Guide.pdf) . This provides Goregutz with skill proficiencies in: Athletics and Persuasion.  It provides tool proficiencies in: one type of gaming set (we will choose dice) and land vehicles.  It provides no additional languages.  It also provides Goregutz with: a uniform of his company (traveler's clothes), an insignia of his rank, a gaming set of his choice (dice), and a pouch containing the last of his wages (10gp).

  Note: It may be tempting to pick a background that provides the most mechanical bonuses, but does not make much sense with character building.  It is up to you to decide whether you value mechanical benefits or roleplay with how you design your character!
