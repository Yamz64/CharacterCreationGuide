# Abridged Character Creation
This is a quick guide to character creation for dungeons and dragons 5th addition!  While most every edition has it's benefits and drawbacks, 5th edition's strength is the ease of use and speed of generating content.  Please note that this guide is a quick and dirty way to set up characters, but not definitive.  All information found here is available in the [*2014 Player's Handbook*]().  Some classes or races may not be included here or in the handbook, but are found in expansion guides, such as *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*, or *Volo's Complete Subrace Handbook*.  If you find something that you would like to use for your character that isn't included in the core rulebooks, bring it up with your DM!

###
Before creating or playing D&D 5th edition, you will need some materials.  This includes but is not limited to the following items:

<!-- Material Bullet List Here: -->
{{coloredBullet 
 {{coloredBulletLine
   - A full set of playing dice.  This includes d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20 dice.  Where the number denotes the amount of sides to the dice.  While this can be handled using an app on your phone or in your browser, it is fun to roll physical dice!
}}
  {{coloredBulletLine
   - A character sheet.  This could be an excel sheet, an online character sheet, the classic [pdf](https://media.wizards.com/2022/dnd/downloads/DnD_5E_CharacterSheet_FormFillable.pdf) included with the *Player's Handbook*, or good old fashioned pencil and paper.

This guide not only lays out the steps to making characters in 5th edition, but provides examples.  These examples take form in a character we will create together, an orc barbarian known as Goregutz Teefgrabba, or Goregutz for short.  Don't worry if you don't completely follow everything in his examples.  A sample character sheet will be provided at the end.

## Race, Class, & Background

### Race

:

The first step to character creation is choosing a race.  Races provide both mechanical advantages, and aesthetic quirks (for short, we call these quirks "flavor").  Races often provide the following mechanics:

<!-- Race Mechanics List Goes Here: -->
{{coloredBullet
{{coloredBulletLine
- **Ability Score Increase:** Every race has bonuses to stats.  Usually this comes in the form of +2 to one stat, and +1 to another stat.  Some races in some of the expansion guides have negatives to their stats.
}}
{{coloredBulletLine
- **Size:** Every race has a size associated with them.  While most races are "medium" sized, they can be smaller- down to size "tiny."
}}
{{coloredBulletLine
- **Speed:** Most races have a walkspeed of 30ft per turn.  While races in the *Player's Handbook,* can have less speed.  Races in some of the expansions can have more. 
}}
{{coloredBulletLine
- **Additional Mechanics:** Races may come with other abilities not described in the previous bullets.
}}

Unless you are playing a mechanically focused game, a character's flavor is just as important.  Races provide various descriptions as well as aesthetic stats.  The more aesthetic stats are as follows:

<!-- Race Aesthetics List Goes Here: -->
{{coloredBullet
{{coloredBulletLine
- **Age:** Different races live for different timespans.  Some die relatively young, and some live to become ancient beings.  When thinking of a character's age, it may be helpful to take into account what stage of life they are in.  Are they old?  Are they young?
}}
{{coloredBulletLine
- **Alignment:** Some races are more inclined to a specific alignment.  While you do not have to follow this when creating your character.  It is still important to keep in mind as it may affect how others perceive your character ingame.
}}
{{coloredBulletLine
- **Languages:** Many races have their own languages.  Being a part of a race allows you to learn that language.  Depending on the setting, this may affect who you can converse with.
}}
}}

The following races are included in the *Player's Handbook* (please note that the expansion books may contain additional races, subraces, and balancing changes):

<!-- Race List Here: -->
{{coloredBullet
- Dwarf
- Elf
- Halfling
- Human
- Dragonborn
- Gnome
- Half-Elf
- Half-Orc
- Tiefling
}}

:

Many races also have **subraces** to consider when creating your character.  Subraces may have additional ability score increases, abilities, or other bonuses that get added on top of the parent race's. If the race you picked has multiple subraces, you must also pick one of them.

:

{{color:DarkGreen 
If we were to pick a race for Goregutz, we could use the "Orc" race and "Mountain Orc" subrace, from [*Volo's Complete Subrace Handbook*]().  But to keep things consistent with using base *Player's Handbook* material, we will use the "Half-Orc" race.  

:

This gives him +2 Strength, and +1 Constitution.  It also gives him medium size, a movement speed of 30ft per turn, Darkvision, proficiency in the intimidation skill, the *"Relentless Endurance"* ability, the *"Savage Attacks"* ability, and the orcish language.

:

Additionally, we can add some flavor to Goregutz based on his race.  Orcs (as per [*Volo's Guide to Monsters*]()) reach maturity at age 12 and can live up to 50 years.  Goregutz is a little over middle aged, so we can assume that he is around 35 years old.  Most orcs have the chaotic evil alignment.  Goregutz is like most orcs, but works as a mercenary.  He values getting paid more than simply "krumping" his enemies, so he is more of a chaotic neutral character.  While it may seem like he is tall, he is actually average among orcs, standing at around 7' 2" and weighing 250lbs.

### Class

While races provide an important mechanical start, and flavorful background for your character.  The class is what you will be spending the most time with.  You can think of it as your character's job.  Are they a knight in shining armor?  They may be a paladin.  Are they a conniving thief?  They may be a rogue.  Do they raise the dead?  They might be a wizard.  It is important to research and decide what class you want to play, as it not only determines how you play the game, but also further builds your character's personality and aesthetics.
